This is an application that lets your joy cons vibrate to build a remote
controlled vehicle like the labo one. Touch the left screen half to move the
vehicle to the left and the right screen half to move the vehicle to the right.
You can even see what the vehicle sees thanks to the IR camera in the joy cons.
It's a very good demo of the technical features of the switch because it uses
multitouch, the detachable joy cons and the "HD Rumble" feature. 

Note:
The rumble feature worked fine yesterday but today it's not working fine any more.
That's probably because it just recently got added to libnx. But also the reason
why I don't release a binary yet. I will release a binary when it's fixed.

Dependencies:
A working installation of the latest libnx from the github repo

Tcm0 from the FUK-Team
